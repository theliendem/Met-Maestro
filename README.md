# Met Maestro

A professional metronome and show management app built with React Native and Expo, featuring precise timing, real-time instrument tuning, and comprehensive show creation tools for musicians.

## Features

### ðŸŽµ Metronome Mode
- **Precise Timing**: WebView-based metronome using Web Audio API for accurate beat timing
- **Time Signatures**: Support for any time signature with visual chevron controls
- **Subdivisions**: Six subdivision options (none, eighth, triplet, sixteenth, quintuplet, sixtuplet)
- **Tap BPM**: Set tempo by tapping with automatic 5-second timeout
- **Sound Options**: Multiple metronome sounds with high/low pitch for downbeats
- **Visual Tempo Bar**: Real-time beat visualization with highlighted segments

### ðŸŽ¼ Show Mode
- **Show Creation**: Create complex musical arrangements with multiple measures
- **Tempo Changes**: Seamless tempo transitions between measures
- **Time Signature Changes**: Support for different time signatures within shows
- **Count-in**: 4-beat count-in before show playback
- **Import/Export**: Save and share shows as files
- **Show Management**: Load, rename, and delete saved shows

### ðŸŽ¯ Instrument Tuner
- **Real-time Pitch Detection**: YIN algorithm for accurate frequency detection
- **Visual Tuner**: Arc-style needle with color-coded in-tune indication
- **Reference Pitch**: Adjustable A4 reference (415-466 Hz)
- **Note Display**: Shows detected note, octave, and cents deviation
- **Low Latency**: <150ms response time using react-native-live-audio-stream

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI
- **Dark Mode Theme**: Professional dark interface with customizable colors
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Large touch targets and clear visual feedback
- **Theme Consistency**: Unified color scheme across all components

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **React Native + Expo**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **WebView Integration**: Self-contained metronome and show components
- **Web Audio API**: Precise audio timing and synthesis
- **AsyncStorage**: Local show persistence
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development

### Audio Systems
- **Metronome Audio**: WebView-based Web Audio API for precise timing
- **Tuner Audio**: react-native-live-audio-stream for real-time pitch detection
- **Performance**: Optimized for battery life and memory usage

### WebView Architecture
The app uses a hybrid architecture where timing-critical components (metronome and show mode) run in WebView containers:

- **Self-contained Logic**: All UI and timing logic contained within WebView HTML/CSS/JS
- **Theme Integration**: React Native theme colors passed to WebView via CSS variables
- **No Communication Overhead**: Eliminates React Native â†” WebView sync issues
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: Same behavior on iOS and Android
