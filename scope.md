## **Overview**
Refactor from multiple WebView architecture to single SoundSystem WebView with React Native UI components. This consolidates all sound logic into one invisible WebView while maintaining three separate tab screens with native React Native UI components.

## **Architecture Summary**
```

```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Three separate, focused screens** - each with its own specialized UI
- **One powerful sound system** - handling all audio logic invisibly
- **Clean communication** - each screen talks to the shared sound system
- **Better performance** - native UI components instead of WebView rendering

## **Objectives**
- **Single SoundSystem WebView**: Consolidate all sound logic from WebViewMetronome, WebViewShow, and WebViewTuner into one invisible WebView
- **Three Separate React Native UI Screens**: Maintain three distinct tab screens (Metronome, Show, Tuner) each with their own React Native UI components
- **Unified Message Passing**: Create consistent communication protocol between all UI screens and the single sound system
- **Maintained Functionality**: Ensure all existing features work identically with new architecture
- **Seamless Mode Switching**: Switch between modes without audio interruption, with proper state management

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Step 6.1: Foundation - SoundSystem Component** ✅
- ✅ Create `SoundSystem.tsx` component - invisible WebView combining all sound logic
- Extract HTML content from WebViewMetronome, WebViewShow, and WebViewTuner
- Create consolidated HTML template with all audio/sound logic (no UI elements)
- ✅ Implement unified message protocol for communication
- ✅ Create SoundSystem Context/Provider for app-wide access

### **Step 6.2: React Native UI Components** ✅
- ✅ **Shared Components**: TimeSignatureSelector, BpmControls, PlayButton, TempoBar, SettingsButton
- ✅ **Metronome UI**: SubdivisionControls, SoundControls, MetronomeControls
- ✅ **Show UI**: ShowSelector, PlaybackControls, ShowVisualizer, PlaybackOptionsModal
- ✅ **Tuner UI**: TunerDisplay, TunerNeedle, NoteDisplay, ReferencePitchControl, PermissionPrompt

### **Step 6.3: Screen Refactoring** ✅

### **Step 6.4: State Management & Communication** ✅
- ✅ Implement cross-mode state management with useSoundSystem hook (via SoundSystemContext)
- ✅ Create SoundSystemBridge for reliable message passing (basic messaging implemented)
- ✅ Implement event system for real-time communication (beats, measure completion, tuner data)
- ✅ Add proper error handling and timeout management (via event system)

### **Step 6.5: Lifecycle & Performance** 🔄
- ✅ Update app root layout with SoundSystemProvider
- Update audio session management for single WebView
- Implement proper focus/blur handling for mode switching
- Update performance monitoring for new architecture

### **Step 6.6: Testing & Validation**
- Update testing infrastructure for new component structure
- Create integration tests for SoundSystem communication
- Validate all functionality works with React Native UI
- Performance benchmarking with new architecture

## **Success Criteria**
- ✅ All sound functionality works identically to current version
- ✅ Three separate tab screens maintained with independent React Native UIs
- ✅ All UI interactions work smoothly with React Native components
- ✅ Seamless switching between modes without audio interruption
- ✅ Single SoundSystem WebView handles all audio for all three modes
- ✅ Theme system works across all components and screens
- ✅ Settings persistence maintained
- ✅ <10ms timing accuracy maintained for metronome
- ✅ <150ms tuner latency maintained
- ✅ Memory usage optimized for single WebView
- ✅ Battery optimization improved
- ✅ Smooth UI interactions with 60fps
- ✅ Each screen can independently control the shared sound system

## **Migration Benefits**
- **Better Performance**: Native UI components render faster than WebView
- **Easier Maintenance**: Separation of UI and sound logic
- **Reduced Complexity**: Single WebView instead of three separate ones
- **Better Debugging**: Native components are easier to debug and test
- **Future-Proof**: Easier to extend and modify individual components

# **Potential future ideas**
1. ✅ Subdivisions per beat
2. ✅ Accent patterns (e.g. for 7/8: O-o-O-o-O-o-o). Add in presets but also allow the user to create their own.
3. ✅ Tap tempo: Add a button which lets the user set the tempo by tapping on the button consistently.
4. Practice modes: the tempo gradually increases/decreases over time.
5. ✅ Customizable sounds: offer a variety of different presets for sounds like woodblock, cowbell, electronic clicks etc.
6. Recording/playback? For practice, allow the user to record themself playing with the met then be able to listen back and check their timing.
7. Timer/practice session log
8. Polyrhythm support? maybe with visuals too
9. ✅ Different themes for customizability
- Make it so you can choose in settings if you want the UI to match your device's theme, or be in dark or light mode all the time.
10. Add a stats page where you can see how much you've played each show, how long you've had the app open, etc.
11. Live waveform or spectrum visualiser for tuner screen
12. ✅ Make it so if you tap on the slider bar in the met mode, it'll go there (so you don't have necessarily have to slide)
13. Add a swipe gesture where you can swipe left or right to the next/previous tab, with an animation.
14. Music scanning feature: Allow users to scan their sheet music using the device camera, and the app automatically translates the time signatures, tempo markings, and measure structure into a show. This would use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to detect musical notation and convert it into the app's show format.
15. Add a "piano" section to tuner to allow for tuning to a note.
16. Add a new type of measure- a "transition" measure where it slowly changes tempo until it reaches the next tempo, instead of instantly jumping tempo

# **NOTES TO SELF**
## For submitting new versions to App Store:
First increment version number and ios.buildNumber in app.json. THEN go into ios/MetMaestro/Info.plist and change the version and Bundle Version (VERY IMPORTANT!!! It will not work if you don't do both). Then do `eas build -p ios --profile production` then `eas submit -p ios --latest`
## For building to a local simulator:
Before you make a build, go into eas.json and make sure that build.development.simulator is has `"simulator": true`. then make a local build using `eas build -p ios --profile development --local` (--local is important). Then extract the build-XXXXXX.tar.gz file. Then, run `xcrun simctl install booted MetMaestro.app` if a simulator is open, or run `xcrun simctl list devices` to view the UUID of all installed sims then `xcrun simctl install [UUID] build-simulator/MetMaestro.app`. It should then be installed on the specified sim. Finally, run `npx expo start` to start the dev server.

## **FIXED: Archive Missing Bundle Identifier Error (2025-01-13)**

**Problem:** Production builds were failing with "Archive Missing Bundle Identifier" error due to version mismatches between configuration files.

**Root Cause:** 
- `app.json` specified version `3.0.0` and build number `7`
- Xcode project was still using `MARKETING_VERSION = 1.0` and `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1`
- Android `versionCode` was `1` while iOS build number was `7`
- EAS production build configuration was missing explicit iOS settings

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Updated iOS Xcode Project (`ios/MetMaestro.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`):**
   - Changed `MARKETING_VERSION` from `1.0` to `3.0.0` for both Debug and Release configurations
   - Changed `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` from `1` to `7` for Release configuration

2. **Updated Android Build Configuration (`android/app/build.gradle`):**
   - Changed `versionCode` from `1` to `7` to match iOS build number

3. **Enhanced EAS Build Configuration (`eas.json`):**
   - Added explicit iOS build configuration for production:
   ```json
   "production": {
     "autoIncrement": true,
     "ios": {
       "buildConfiguration": "Release"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Cleaned and Rebuilt Dependencies:**
   - Removed old build artifacts, Pods, and Podfile.lock
   - Ran `npx expo install --fix` to ensure dependency compatibility
   - Reinstalled pods with `pod install`

**Result:** Bundle identifier is now properly recognized during production builds, resolving the archive error.
